# Overview

- The Hashing Application is a web-based tool that enables users to hash strings using various cryptographic algorithms.
- With a simple and intuitive interface, users can select their desired algorithm and see the resulting hash instantly. -This application is ideal for developers, security professionals, and anyone interested in understanding cryptographic hashing.

# Key Features

Multiple Hashing Algorithms: Choose from several cryptographic hashing algorithms, including:

- SHA-256
- SHA-1
- MD5
- SHA-512
- SHA3
- HMAC (SHA-256, SHA-512)

1. User-Friendly Interface: An easy-to-navigate interface that allows users to input strings and select algorithms seamlessly.

2. Real-Time Hash Generation: Instant feedback with real-time hash generation as users enter their input and select algorithms.

## Technologies Used

1. Frontend: Built using React for a responsive user interface.
2. CryptoJS: A JavaScript library providing cryptographic algorithms for hashing.
